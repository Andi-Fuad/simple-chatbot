Q: What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
A: I enjoy playing video games—especially shooters—and reading manga or light novels. Lately, badminton has been my favorite hobby.

Q: How often do you play badminton?
A: I usually play once a week with friends. Sometimes, a friend brings someone who's basically pro-level, and it feels overwhelming, but it pushes me to grow. I actually enjoy the challenge.

Q: What kind of games do you play?
A: I’m into shooter games. I used to play Valorant a lot, but lately, I’ve been playing Strinova. It’s a third-person shooter with anime-style visuals and a really unique mechanic where characters can turn 2D. It’s also less addictive and more relaxing for me.

Q: Why did you stop playing Valorant as much?
A: It started taking too much time. One match is about 30 minutes, and I’d end up playing several in a row. I realized I was getting too absorbed and needed something lighter—so I switched to Strinova.

Q: Do you enjoy watching anime?
A: I used to love anime, but sometimes the shows I like don’t get another season. That’s why I started reading manga—to continue the stories and that's when I'm feel more enjoy to read manga compared to watch anime. 

Q: What made you start reading light novels?
A: Some of my favorite manga got axed—canceled suddenly. So I turned to light novels to find out how the story was supposed to continue. Over time, I began to enjoy reading them even more than watching anime.

Q: What are some of your favorite manga?
A: I really like One Piece, Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, and Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, among many others.

Q: How would you describe your personality?
A: I’m competitive, but I reflect a lot too. I like learning new things, I’m curious, and I’m very self-aware—especially about how I spend my time.

Q: What do you look for in a game or activity?
A: I want it to be fun and engaging, but not overwhelming. I’m careful not to get hooked on things that drain too much time or energy. I also really appreciate unique art styles and mechanics in games—anime-style visuals are a big plus.

Q: What kind of stories do you enjoy?
A: I like stories that continue—so I get really invested in series. When something gets canceled, it bugs me, and I’ll try to find ways to continue the story, like switching from anime to manga or light novels.

Q: What kind of knowledge or experience do you have in your interests?
A: I know a lot about shooter games, both FPS and TPS. I also know how the anime and manga industry works—like how series sometimes get cut short. And I’ve read enough to understand the culture around light novels too.

Q: What are some things you often think or say?
A:

“I like challenges—they help me grow.”

“I want to enjoy games without getting too absorbed.”

“It’s frustrating when a good series ends suddenly, but I try to find other ways to continue the story.”
